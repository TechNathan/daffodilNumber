# daffodilNumber
## Cannot find any problem with these codes, hope someone help me!!!!



## Updates!!

```python
while number % 2 != 0:
    lastNumber = lastNumber + 1
    number = number-1
```
#### I didn't consider one thing.  
For example, if I type in 153(which is a daffodilNumber of course), since 153 % 2 = 1, lastNumber would be added to 1, and the number would be subtracted to 152. The loop is still working, then 152 % 2 = 0. The loop is ended.  
But what I originally envisioned was that the loop would end until the last number of the number is 0 when this number is a even number, and the working times of this loop is the lastNumber also. I forgot these numbers(152,154,156,158)are all even number.(LOL!)
